# <Note-Taker-App>

## Description

This application is a note taking site which allows users to write, save, reopen, and delete notes on the page.  
Through building this project, I learned to use Node.js, Express.js, and Heroku together to deploy a functional webpage.  I practiced writing backend for an application through creating a server file with HTTP routes for the frontend of the site to be able to run Fetch requests.  I also learned how to use modular routing and modular code to organize my code's functionality to be more easily understandable.

## Installation

To install this project, you can use node's "npm install" command to install the project's dependencies.

## Usage

To run the application, you can visit the URL at: https://shielded-wildwood-64425.herokuapp.com/ .
You can click "Get Started" to be redirected to the notes page.  There, you can view the title's of previously written notes on the left side of the screen.  Clicking one of these titles will make the full note appear on the right side of the screen.  From here, you can press the plus button on the top right of the site to add a new note.  Once you've added a note title and a note, you can press the save icon on the top right of the screen to save your note.  The delete icon next to each of the note titles on the left side of the screen allow you to delete any notes that you would like to remove from the page.
